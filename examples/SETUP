pajmcrud directory and the example directory should be in the same directory or variables and symbolic links will have to be changed.
Eg. 
/var/www/html/pajmcrud
/var/www/html/casetracker

ls -l casetracker/
casetracker_conf.inc
../pajmcrud/css
../pajmcrud/indices/index.php
../pajmcrud/js
pages
../pajmcrud/indices/staging.php

Also, the PAGENAME_conf.inc file should be named the same as the page directory.
Eg. casetracker_conf.inc
and the DB variables and pages on the side menu can be determined there.
